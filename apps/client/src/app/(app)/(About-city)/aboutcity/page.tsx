                  Portland is known for its progressive values, green
                  initiatives, and cultural characterâ€”especially in the arts,
                  food, and environmental sectors.

                <p>
                  Situated at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia
                  Rivers, in the shadow of Mount Hood, Portland enjoys a mild,
                  temperate climate.

                  The city is characterized by lush, forested hills,
                  particularly in the west. East of the Willamette, the terrain
                  flattens into the fertile Willamette Valley.

                <p>
                  The city has an urban growth boundary to control sprawl and
                  protect nearby farms and forests, which has helped Portland
                  stay compact and green.
